# stickbread
This project is about making the perfect stickbread. 

According to kingarthurbaking.com, yeast bread is fully baked at temperatures of around 190°F (88°C). 
To achieve evenly baked bread, we'll keep the bread turning slowly over charcoal. 

## Materials: 
- digital [temperature sensor DS18B20](https://www.berrybase.de/ds18b20-ic-digitaler-temperatursensor-wasserdicht)
- suitable resistor (check!)
- stepper motor
- esp32
- anything else?

## Getting started
[This video](https://youtu.be/tc3Qnf79Ny8?si=-Rb_QZbjWIWu2cQ2) shows you how to use Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO to program the ESP32. 
If you prefer to follow instructions on a website, then check the [tutorial](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/vs-code-platformio-ide-esp32-esp8266-arduino/) done by _randomnerdtutorials_.
